            <h2>Why a Returnship?</h2>
            <p>In 2019, I realized I needed to strengthen my educational foundation to excel as a software engineer. I took a break from full-time software work to pursue degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics. Now, with a solid academic background and practical experience, I'm excited to apply my enhanced skills and knowledge in a professional setting. I am so glad I found the Returnship program. I think that I will be an asset to the team and mutually that I would be enriched by this program. I would love to contribute to Home Depot's mission and have a small part in helping our customers build their dreams.</p>

            <h2>Why Home Depot?</h2>
            <p>Growing up in a construction family, I've always had a deep appreciation for building and home improvement. My background in software engineering, combined with my recent experience in construction project management, uniquely positions me to contribute to Home Depot's mission. I understand both the technical aspects of software development and the practical needs of contractors and DIY enthusiasts. This blend of skills allows me to bridge the gap between technology and the real-world applications in the home improvement industry. I love to build, and I want to help builders build.</p>
